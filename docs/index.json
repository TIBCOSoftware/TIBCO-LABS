As edge devices improve and become more capable, IoT data processing is best accomplished with simple-to-use tools well integrated into a single platform. The Project AIR™ solution enables centralized access and management of IoT devices, efficient processing and storage of IoT derived data, and support for running analytics both at the edge and in the cloud. These capabilities make the edge a seamless part of your digital transformation program and reduce the time needed to automate key decisions.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\r\r\r\t\rProject ART As companies increasingly leverage augmented reality (AR/XR) to enhance customer experience and increase productivity, data will need to be consumed in even more ways. From holograms to 3D visualizations, augmented reality applications offer new ways to access enterprise data regardless of volume, including for voice control and automatic hands-free access. The Project ART solution makes development of AR/XR applications easier, and the user experience richer, with more possibilities for interactivity and fun.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\rProject Dovetail™ Today, there is no standardization for the creation and use of blockchain smart contracts. Tooling capabilities vary, and if you chose the wrong technology, you risk having to start from scratch with little hope of migration. It is also difficult to integrate contract logic with the rest of your systems and applications, further limiting the ability to consume blockchain technology within the enterprise. Project Dovetail™ solution addresses these problems with a model-driven approach to smart contract development and testing.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\r\r\r\t\rProject Cloud Conversations Want to have a conversation with your data? Project Cloud Conversations solution offers new ways of exploring and interacting with enterprise data. Using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and the now ubiquitous paradigm of a “chatbot” user interface, Project Cloud Conversations solution provides enterprise users with a simple-to-use tool for querying enterprise knowledge.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\rTIBCO Cloud™ Starters Need to quickly build cloud applications using the latest web technologies? TIBCO Cloud™ Starters solution brings the power of the TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud to solution development. With TIBCO Cloud Starters development toolkits, customers can leverage the capability domains from TIBCO Cloud software as a service to quickly build applications for the toughest business problems. Combine best-of-breed capabilities such as microservices and APIs, case management, messaging, decision management, and analytics into a single, unified application using these components.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\r\r\r\n\rAutoML for TIBCO® Data Science - Team Studio Need to expand your ability to develop machine learning models? Want to automate activities related to data prep, feature extraction, feature engineering, and model selection? Need to explain, score, and manage these models seamlessly in your environment? AutoML for TIBCO® Data Science – Team Studio software for business analysts and data scientists provides automated generation of ML workflows for a wide range of data science problems. Generated solutions are open and allow for fine-tuning, and the visual approach makes it easy for users to understand overall flow and logic.\nVIEW on TIBCO Community\n\r\rProject Discover™ Understanding the variety of business processes within an organization can be very challenging. How do you know if processes are being executed as expected? Do resource bottlenecks exist? And just how many variations of the same process do you have? Project Discover™ solution is a process-mining solution built on the TIBCO Connected Intelligence Cloud that allows customers to discover, learn, improve, and predict process behaviors from event logs produced by operational systems.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\r\r\r\n\rProject GraphBuilder Project GraphBuilder offers an easy and powerful way to load data from multiple enterprise data sources into TIBCO® Graph Database and/or any graph database of your choice , both in batch and real-time. Leverage the power of relationships to discover new business insights that were previously hidden in your data. Project GraphBuilder makes it simple for you to efficiently traverse, analyze, and access complex relationships across your organization, and convert this dynamic data into a form that is easy to understand and leverage.\nVIEW on GITHUB\n\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\rFollow us on Twitter!\rFor announcement of latest features etc\u0026hellip;\nRead more …\n\r\r\r\r","excerpt":"#td-cover-block-0 {\rbackground-image: …","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/TIBCO-LABS/","title":"TIBCO LABS™ Overview"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"https://tibcosoftware.github.io/TIBCO-LABS/search/","title":"Search Results"}]
